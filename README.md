Tools for analyzing stellar activity in RV spectra

Note: This is a work in progress so I would not recommend anybody using this repository without contacting me first. I will remove this message when I have finished commenting and migrating my code to this repository.

The purpose of this repository is to make public all of the code that Alexander Wise has used to generate published papers:

(1) Wise et al. 2018: New Methods for Finding Activity-Sensitive Lines: Combined Visual Identification and an Automated Pipeline Find a set of 40 Activity Indicators.

(2) TBD

These include tools for normalizing HARPS spectra, identifying abosprotion lines and measuring spectral line properties.
