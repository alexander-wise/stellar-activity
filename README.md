Tools for analyzing stellar activity in RV spectra

The purpose of this repository is to make public all of the code that Alexander Wise has used to generate published papers:

(1) Wise et al. 2018: New Methods for Finding Activity-Sensitive Lines: Combined Visual Identification and an Automated Pipeline Find a set of 40 Activity Indicators.

(2) TBD

These include tools for normalizing HARPS spectra, identifying abosprotion lines and measuring spectral line properties.
